I want to create an app for a trading card game.
Players can collect cards for heroes and items, trade cards,
go to exploration and battle with their cards, and collect loot from these actions.

**Data Management:**
- The data for the cards (heroes and items) are stored in CSV files.
- The app will need to read, write, and update data from the CSV files.
- There will be a reward system for winning battles and completing exploration, but this data will not be stored in the CSV files.
- Loot data will be generated by GPT's API and will not be stored in the CSV files.

**User Management:**
- Users will need to create an account to play the game.
- User accounts will allow users to access their card collections and game history.
- User accounts will need to be stored in the CSV files.
- User account data will include username, password, and email.
- User authentication and authorization will be handled using Auth0.

**App Logic:**
- Players can collect cards for heroes and items, trade cards, go to exploration and battle with their cards, and collect loot from these actions.
- Trading happens directly between players.
- Players select a location and cards to play for exploration and battle.
- This information is sent to GPT's API to create a description of events.
- Loot is also created by GPT based on the events that it came up with.
- Items are cards that can be used with hero cards.
- Items can be used as many times as the player wants.

**User Interface:**
- The UI will display cards, items, and locations, showing their name, image, and description.
- The UI will allow users to select cards for trading, exploration, and battle.
- The UI will also display user account information such as their card collection and game history.

**Other Aspects:**
- The app is expected to have a relatively small user base of a few hundred users.
- The app will be hosted in the cloud and use Streamlit as the development framework.
- The app will use CSV files as the database for storing user and card data.
- User accounts will not have additional features such as password reset or email verification.
